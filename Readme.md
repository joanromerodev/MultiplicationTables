- ✨ You can easily change the right variable to select the amount of tables to create ✨

## Technologies

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - evented I/O for the backend
- [FileSystem](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/fs.html) - This module enables interacting with the file system in a way modeled on standard POSIX functions.

It only requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install NodeJS globally by downloading and running the .exc file in your PC from their official website [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

If you got the version with no problem, you can now clone this app using Git in your directory by running this command
